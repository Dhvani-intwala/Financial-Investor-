            <div class="panel">
                <p>No. The only person that can have access to your investment funds is yourself. The funds are linked to your nominated personal bank account. Any money that you withdraw from your broker account is restricted to be transferred to your bank account only.</p>

                <h5>What Happens if I Do Not transfer the Profits from the Account.</h5>
            </div>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>It is OK to not transfer money from the account but any extra  money in the account than the required equity balance is not working for you so it may be better put back into your bank account.
                    It is recommended to withdraw at the month end after you have received the Closed Profit report from the broker so the correct amount of 80% of Closed Profits can be taken out.</p>

                <h5>Does the System Make Profits Every Day.</h5>
            </div>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>The system has as a very high winning strike rate so it does make profit on most days. However on some days it does make a small loss- this is a normal part of the strategy and Forex trading. The important thing is at the end of the month the design of the system is to deliver Closed Profits at the end of the month.</p>

                <div class="icon"></div>
                <h5>Why is there Always Open Losing Trades</h5>
            </div>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>This is part of the strategy design. The high volume micro trading strategies allow a new position to open as soon as a previous open position has closed. The open positions will always stay open until the system closes each of those trades.. So open positions all at a loss is a standard and correct part of the way the system is designed to trade. As soon as they reach their target they will close and a new position will normally open .</p>
